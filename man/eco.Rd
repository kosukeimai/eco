\arguments{
\item{formula}{A symbolic description of the model to be fit, specifying the
column and row margins of \eqn{2 \times 2} ecological tables. \code{Y ~ X}
specifies \code{Y} as the column margin (e.g., turnout) and \code{X} as the
row margin (e.g., percent African-American). Details and specific examples
are given below.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame in which to interpret the variables in
\code{formula}. The default is the environment in which \code{eco} is
called.}

\item{N}{An optional variable representing the size of the unit; e.g., the
total number of voters. \code{N} needs to be a vector of same length as
\code{Y} and \code{X} or a scalar.}

\item{supplement}{An optional matrix of supplemental data. The matrix has
two columns, which contain additional individual-level data such as survey
data for \eqn{W_1} and \eqn{W_2}, respectively.  If \code{NULL}, no
additional individual-level data are included in the model. The default is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{context}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the contextual effect is also
modeled, that is to assume the row margin \eqn{X} and the unknown \eqn{W_1}
and \eqn{W_2} are correlated. See Imai, Lu and Strauss (2008, 2011) for
details. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{mu0}{A scalar or a numeric vector that specifies the prior mean for
the mean parameter \eqn{\mu} for \eqn{(W_1,W_2)} (or for \eqn{(W_1, W_2, X)}
if \code{context=TRUE}). When the input of \code{mu0} is a scalar, its value
will be repeated to yield a vector of the length of \eqn{\mu}, otherwise, it
needs to be a vector of same length as \eqn{\mu}. When \code{context=TRUE},
the length of \eqn{\mu} is 3, otherwise it is 2. The default is \code{0}.}

\item{tau0}{A positive integer representing the scale parameter of the
Normal-Inverse Wishart prior for the mean and variance parameter \eqn{(\mu,
\Sigma)}. The default is \code{2}.}

\item{nu0}{A positive integer representing the prior degrees of freedom of
the Normal-Inverse Wishart prior for the mean and variance parameter
\eqn{(\mu, \Sigma)}. The default is \code{4}.}

\item{S0}{A positive scalar or a positive definite matrix that specifies the
prior scale matrix of the Normal-Inverse Wishart prior for the mean and
variance parameter \eqn{(\mu, \Sigma)} . If it is a scalar, then the prior
scale matrix will be a diagonal matrix with the same dimensions as
\eqn{\Sigma} and the diagonal elements all take value of \code{S0},
otherwise \code{S0} needs to have same dimensions as \eqn{\Sigma}. When
\code{context=TRUE}, \eqn{\Sigma} is a \eqn{3 \times 3} matrix, otherwise,
it is \eqn{2 \times 2}.  The default is \code{10}.}

\item{mu.start}{A scalar or a numeric vector that specifies the starting
values of the mean parameter \eqn{\mu}.  If it is a scalar, then its value
will be repeated to yield a vector of the length of \eqn{\mu}, otherwise, it
needs to be a vector of same length as \eqn{\mu}.  When
\code{context=FALSE}, the length of \eqn{\mu} is 2, otherwise it is 3. The
default is \code{0}.}

\item{Sigma.start}{A scalar or a positive definite matrix that specified the
starting value of the variance matrix \eqn{\Sigma}. If it is a scalar, then
the prior scale matrix will be a diagonal matrix with the same dimensions as
\eqn{\Sigma} and the diagonal elements all take value of \code{S0},
otherwise \code{S0} needs to have same dimensions as \eqn{\Sigma}. When
\code{context=TRUE}, \eqn{\Sigma} is a \eqn{3 \times 3} matrix, otherwise,
it is \eqn{2 \times 2}.  The default is \code{10}.}

\item{parameter}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the Gibbs draws of the population
parameters, \eqn{\mu} and \eqn{\Sigma}, are returned in addition to the
in-sample predictions of the missing internal cells, \eqn{W}. The default is
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{grid}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the grid method is used to sample
\eqn{W} in the Gibbs sampler. If \code{FALSE}, the Metropolis algorithm is
used where candidate draws are sampled from the uniform distribution on the
tomography line for each unit. Note that the grid method is significantly
slower than the Metropolis algorithm.  The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{n.draws}{A positive integer. The number of MCMC draws.  The default is
\code{5000}.}

\item{burnin}{A positive integer. The burnin interval for the Markov chain;
i.e. the number of initial draws that should not be stored. The default is
\code{0}.}

\item{thin}{A positive integer. The thinning interval for the Markov chain;
i.e. the number of Gibbs draws between the recorded values that are skipped.
The default is \code{0}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the progress of the Gibbs sampler is
printed to the screen. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
\code{eco} is used to fit the parametric Bayesian model (based on a
Normal/Inverse-Wishart prior) for ecological inference in \eqn{2 \times 2}
tables via Markov chain Monte Carlo. It gives the in-sample predictions as
well as the estimates of the model parameters. The model and algorithm are
described in Imai, Lu and Strauss (2008, 2011).
}
\details{
An example of \eqn{2 \times 2} ecological table for racial voting is given
below: \tabular{llccc}{ \tab \tab black voters \tab white voters \tab \cr
\tab vote \tab \eqn{W_{1i}} \tab \eqn{W_{2i}} \tab \eqn{Y_i} \cr \tab not
vote \tab \eqn{1-W_{1i}} \tab \eqn{1-W_{2i}} \tab \eqn{1-Y_i} \cr \tab \tab
\eqn{X_i} \tab \eqn{1-X_i} \tab } where \eqn{Y_i} and \eqn{X_i} represent
the observed margins, and \eqn{W_1} and \eqn{W_2} are unknown variables. In
this exmaple, \eqn{Y_i} is the turnout rate in the ith precint, \eqn{X_i} is
the proproption of African American in the ith precinct. The unknowns
\eqn{W_{1i}} an d\eqn{W_{2i}} are the black and white turnout, respectively.
All variables are proportions and hence bounded between 0 and 1. For each
\eqn{i}, the following deterministic relationship holds, \eqn{Y_i=X_i
W_{1i}+(1-X_i)W_{2i}}.
