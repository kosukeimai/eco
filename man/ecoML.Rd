\arguments{
\item{formula}{A symbolic description of the model to be fit, specifying the
column and row margins of \eqn{2 \times 2} ecological tables. \code{Y ~ X}
specifies \code{Y} as the column margin (e.g., turnout) and \code{X} (e.g.,
percent African-American) as the row margin. Details and specific examples
are given below.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame in which to interpret the variables in
\code{formula}. The default is the environment in which \code{ecoML} is
called.}

\item{N}{An optional variable representing the size of the unit; e.g., the
total number of voters.  \code{N} needs to be a vector of same length as
\code{Y} and \code{X} or a scalar.}

\item{supplement}{An optional matrix of supplemental data. The matrix has
two columns, which contain additional individual-level data such as survey
data for \eqn{W_1} and \eqn{W_2}, respectively.  If \code{NULL}, no
additional individual-level data are included in the model. The default is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{theta.start}{A numeric vector that specifies the starting values for
the mean, variance, and covariance. When \code{context = FALSE}, the
elements of \code{theta.start} correspond to (\eqn{E(W_1)}, \eqn{E(W_2)},
\eqn{var(W_1)}, \eqn{var(W_2)}, \eqn{cor(W_1,W_2)}). When \code{context =
TRUE}, the elements of \code{theta.start} correspond to (\eqn{E(W_1)},
\eqn{E(W_2)}, \eqn{var(W_1)}, \eqn{var(W_2)}, \eqn{corr(W_1, X)},
\eqn{corr(W_2, X)}, \eqn{corr(W_1,W_2)}). Moreover, when
\code{fix.rho=TRUE}, \eqn{corr(W_1,W_2)} is set to be the correlation
between \eqn{W_1} and \eqn{W_2} when \code{context = FALSE}, and the partial
correlation between \eqn{W_1} and \eqn{W_2} given \eqn{X} when \code{context
= FALSE}. The default is \code{c(0,0,1,1,0)}.}

\item{fix.rho}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the correlation (when
\code{context=TRUE}) or the partial correlation (when \code{context=FALSE})
between \eqn{W_1} and \eqn{W_2} is fixed through the estimation. For
details, see Imai, Lu and Strauss(2006). The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{context}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the contextual effect is also
modeled. In this case, the row margin (i.e., X) and the individual-level
rates (i.e., \eqn{W_1} and \eqn{W_2}) are assumed to be distributed
tri-variate normally (after logit transformations). See Imai, Lu and Strauss
(2006) for details. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{sem}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the standard errors of parameter
estimates are estimated via SEM algorithm, as well as the fraction of
missing data. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{epsilon}{A positive number that specifies the convergence criterion
for EM algorithm. The square root of \code{epsilon} is the convergence
criterion for SEM algorithm. The default is \code{10^(-6)}.}

\item{maxit}{A positive integer specifies the maximum number of iterations
before the convergence criterion is met. The default is \code{1000}.}

\item{loglik}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the value of the log-likelihood
function at each iteration of EM is saved. The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{hyptest}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, model is estimated under the null
hypothesis that means of \eqn{W1} and \eqn{W2} are the same.  The default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the progress of the EM and SEM
algorithms is printed to the screen. The default is \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
\code{ecoML} is used to fit parametric models for ecological inference in
\eqn{2 \times 2} tables via Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms. The
data is specified in proportions. At it's most basic setting, the algorithm
assumes that the individual-level proportions (i.e., \eqn{W_1} and
\eqn{W_2}) and distributed bivariate normally (after logit transformations).
The function calculates point estimates of the parameters for models based
on different assumptions. The standard errors of the point estimates are
also computed via Supplemented EM algorithms. Moreover, \code{ecoML}
quantifies the amount of missing information associated with each parameter
and allows researcher to examine the impact of missing information on
parameter estimation in ecological inference. The models and algorithms are
described in Imai, Lu and Strauss (2008, 2011).
}
\details{
When \code{SEM} is \code{TRUE}, \code{ecoML} computes the observed-data
information matrix for the parameters of interest based on Supplemented-EM
algorithm. The inverse of the observed-data information matrix can be used
to estimate the variance-covariance matrix for the parameters estimated from
EM algorithms. In addition, it also computes the expected complete-data
information matrix. Based on these two measures, one can further calculate
the fraction of missing information associated with each parameter. See
Imai, Lu and Strauss (2006) for more details about fraction of missing
information.

Moreover, when \code{hytest=TRUE}, \code{ecoML} allows to estimate the
parametric model under the null hypothesis that \code{mu_1=mu_2}. One can
then construct the likelihood ratio test to assess the hypothesis of equal
means. The associated fraction of missing information for the test statistic
can be also calculated. For details, see Imai, Lu and Strauss (2006) for
details.

\examples{


## load the census data
data(census)

## NOTE: convergence has not been properly assessed for the following
## examples. See Imai, Lu and Strauss (2006) for more complete analyses.
## In the first example below, in the interest of time, only part of the
## data set is analyzed and the convergence requirement is less stringent
## than the default setting.

## In the second example, the program is arbitrarily halted 100 iterations
## into the simulation, before convergence.

## load the Robinson's census data
data(census)

## fit the parametric model with the default model specifications
\dontrun{res <- ecoML(Y ~ X, data = census[1:100,], N=census[1:100,3], 
	     	  epsilon=10^(-6), verbose = TRUE)}
## summarize the results
\dontrun{summary(res)}

## fit the parametric model with some individual 
## level data using the default prior specification
surv <- 1:600
\dontrun{res1 <- ecoML(Y ~ X, context = TRUE, data = census[-surv,], 
                   supplement = census[surv,c(4:5,1)], maxit=100, verbose = TRUE)}

\dontrun{summary(res1)}
