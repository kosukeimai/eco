\description{
This data set contains, on a county level, the proportion of county
residents who are Black and the proportion of presidential votes cast for
Wallace.  Demographic data is based on the 1960 census. Presidential returns
are from ICPSR study 13.  County data from 10 southern states (Alabama,
Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas) are included. (Virginia is excluded due to the
difficulty of matching counties between the datasets.)  This data is
analyzed in Wallace and Segal (1973).
